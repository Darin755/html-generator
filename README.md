## html-generator

 - a script to generate a html page for files in a directory

### To use:

 - run ``./populate *path-to-directory*`` outside the target directory

### Notes:

 - the script will delete any index.html files in the directory and over write them with the new index.html

 - the script is not recursive (i.e. you must run it once per folder)
